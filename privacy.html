    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 28, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        BillLoop is a bill tracker app designed to help you manage your bills efficiently. 
        Your privacy is very important to us, and this policy explains how your data is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        BillLoop does not collect any personal information from users. The app uses Apple’s CloudKit to store your data securely in your private iCloud account.
    </p>

    <h2>Developer Data Access</h2>
    <p>
        As the developer, I do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. 
        All your content remains private and is accessible only by you.
    </p>

    <h2>CloudKit and iCloud</h2>
    <p>
        Your bills and related content are stored in your personal iCloud account using CloudKit. 
        This ensures your data stays synchronized across all your Apple devices. 
        Data is stored in your private iCloud container and is never shared with the developer or any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Premium Features</h2>
    <p>
        BillLoop offers an optional Pro subscription that unlocks additional features. 
        All transactions are processed securely via Apple’s App Store infrastructure. 
        No payment information is stored or accessed by the app or its developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        BillLoop does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking frameworks. 
        Your app usage is not monitored or profiled in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the revised effective date.
    </p>
